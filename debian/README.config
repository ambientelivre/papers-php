To properly configure a papers instance, you need to copy the conf.php.in file
and fill in your event's settings. The name of the configuration file depends
on the URL you're going to run papers to the public:

Application URL                           | Configuration filename
------------------------------------------+-------------------------------
http://www.blablabla.org/papers           | www.blablabla.org.papers
http://blabla.org/~joerandomhacker/papers | blablabla.org.joerandomhacker.papers


General rule is: hostname (without port number, if it's there) + path to the
application's root, replacing slashes by dots. After that, anything that's not
[a-zA-Z0-9.] is removed. If you have any doubt, see
/usr/share/papers/admin/include/config.php
