Hello {$name},

We're in the last step in fisl6.0's lecture selection process. We had a
high number of submitted proposals, all of high quality and,
unfortunatelly, we cannot accept them all in our program.

We inform you that your lecture proposal for fisl6.0, with title
"{$title}",
have not entered this year program yet, but there's still a
possibility of it being accepted, depending on other factors.

Therefore, we ask you to wait: as soon as we can, we
will notify you of the final result.

Feel free to contact us to solve any doubts you may have by e-mail:
temario@softwarelivre.org

Regards,
