Hello {$name},

We're sorry to inform that your lecture proposal for fisl6.0, with title
"{$title}",
wasn't selected for presentation in the event. We had a large number
of submissions, all with high quality, and we weren't able to accomodate
all of them in the event's program. We're very unconfortable, because
we had to reject several high quality proposals due to this lack of space.

The evaluations assigned to your proposal by the Program Comitee
can be checked through the fisl6.0's Speaker's Corner, in the following
address:

https://fisl.softwarelivre.org/papers/speaker/

To access, use the same e-mail and password that you have used to submit
your proposal.

Thanks for your interest. We hope to have your attendance in fisl6.0,
as well as receive new submissions in the event's next edition.


Feel free to get in touch with us in case of any doubt, by e-mail:
temario@softwarelivre.org

Regards,

--
fisl6.0 Program Comitee
